# Project Description
- For this project, I will create a dupe of this game called "Rise Up"(you can download the game on your mobile phone to try). It basically challenge you to protect the balloon from random obstacles as it rise up. I will use p5play library to help with the physics in the game.


## Needs to have list
- using p5play library for physics - done
- start screen
- two main sprites: the circle as shield for player to control and the balloon - done 
- scrolling background - done
- background music
- score checker
- have at least 7 to 8 different type of obstacles (7 or 8 different ways of arranging the obstacles)
- game over screen, display scores.


## Nice to have list
- local storage to keep track of player's best scores
- let player play again when game over.
- display the game nicely.
